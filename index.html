          <h2>What is Mountain Madness</h2>
          <p>Mountain Madness is the latest of many annual Hackathons organized by the SFU Computing Science Student Society. Our Hackathons are cozy, tight-knit events welcoming students of all skill levels and experience. Every year we come up with a different design and title, and this year we decided to pay homage to Burnaby Mountain, the original foundation of Simon Fraser University. 
          </p>
          <p>Mountain Madness is a 24 hour Hackathon focused around students in the Lower Mainland and beyond; open to all undergraduates at SFU and other institutions in British Columbia. Beyond that, the only requirement is an open mind and a passion to create.
          </p>

          <h2>What is the SFU CSSS</h2>
          <p>
            The Computing Science Student Society is a departmental student society based out of Simon Fraser University. Operating under the Simon Fraser Student Society, we act to recognize the academic and recreational demands of Computing Science students, providing them with a better experience at SFU. We have seats on the School of Computing Science Undergraduate Program Committee and the Faculty of Applied Science Undergraduate Curriculum Committee.
          </p>
          <p>
            The society also facilitates recreational activities, such as LAN parties, board game nights and movie nights, as well as joining the Simon Fraser Student Society and other departmental student societies for events. On a day-to-day level, the society provides services for Computing Science students such as a common area and inexpensive beverages.

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>
            Why nwHacks?
          </h3>
          <p>
            nwHacks is dedicated to creating a thriving community of technology lovers in the Pacific Northwest region by bringing together the brightest minds for an epic two day event.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>
            What should I bring?
          </h3>
          <p>
            nwHacks is a 24h event, which means that hackers should be prepared to sleep overnight at the venue. Be sure to bring everything you need to stay the night, including a sleeping bag! All food will be provided at event so don't worry about that!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>
            What if I don't have any experience?
          </h3>
          <p>
            No worries! Hackathons are really a place for learning. We'll have series of workshops to bootstrap you for hacking so you'll be ready in no time. Mentors will be walking around to help you with any problems you'll face. By the time you walk out, you'll have a new skill under your belt!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>
            How much does it cost?
          </h3>
          <p>
            nwHacks is 100% free for all participants. However, registration is strictly limited to high school and university students, and recent graduates only. A bus will be sent to the University of Washington for attendees from Seattle and the surrounding area. For other hackers, we will be offering a limited number of travel reimbursements of up to $200 per person (economy flights only).
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>
            Can I work on my previous projects?
          </h3>
          <p>
            No, all "hacks" must be built from scratch, although it is ok if you came up with the idea before hand. This rule is strictly adhered to at nwHacks and any team found working on a project that they already started will be automatically disqualified in the event. However this does not apply to any libraries or tools that you have made, so feel free to use libraries and any other code!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>
            How big can my team be?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Teams are usually 2-5 people in size. Teams bigger than 5 people are usually split up into smaller ones, as we've found large teams aren't the best solution for a 24h event. Don't worry if you can't find your team beforehand, staff at the event will help you find other teammates and provide you with many opportunities to find others to help!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>
            What is a "hackathon"?
          </h3>
          <p>
            A hackathon is an event where teams of 2-5 people collaborate on an application within the specified time limit (nwHacks is 24 hours long). Prizes are awarded to the most creative, polished and theme-specific projects or "hacks". The winners will be chosen by a panel of judges comprised of top industry professionals.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>
            What happens if I don't have a team?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Don't worry! A lot of hackers just like you are in the same position. On the first day of the event, we will make sure to pair everyone up with a team of hackers so no one gets left out! There will also be an opportunity to connect with people and form teams before the event (after you have been chosen to attend).
